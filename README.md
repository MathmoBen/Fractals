# Fractals
Attempts to use Python to plot some well-known fractal constructions.

Koch curve: we plot some kotch snowflakes.

Mandelbrot: we use numpy to draw the Fatou set of the well-known Mandelbrot set but also plot some interesting variants.

Newton: we plot the Newton fractals corresponding to a few different polynomials with various interesting properties. 

Hally: similar to the Newton fractals but deploying a slightly different method of approximating the results.
